A constructor in C++ is a special member function (method) of class tha initialises objects of the class.
It has the same name as the class and does not have return type.
Constructors are called automatically when an object of the class is created.



Types of constructors:

    DEFAULT CONSTRUCTOR:
        A constructor that takes no arguments

    PARAMETERIZED CONSTRUCTOR:
        A constructor that takes arguments to initialise the object with specific values.

    COPY CONSTRUCTOR:
        A constructor that initialises an object using another object of the same class.
